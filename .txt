Set up two int counters for wins, 
	how do I store wins and update them?
	what data type stores numbers?
	- enemy wins
	- my wins

when someone wins increase win counters (increment)



Game ends at 5 wins for either player or computer

game to stop at 5 wins
- two counters

if either win counters are 5 or higher
 if playerwins or computerwins equal to 5
	- restart game

we want to have the loss/win/draw shown on the screen and not just to the console
